	/** \name Def aliasing.
		Aliasing a def provides a different view of the def providing access
		via a different type, or access to members of structs, unions and
		arrays.

		Alias defs are very simple: they store only the type and relative
		offset off the def they alias. All other information is held in the
		def they alias, including relocation records. However, they do keep
		track of the source file and line that first created the alias.

		The relations between a def and any of its aliases are maintained by
		a linked list headed by def_t::alias_defs and connected by
		def_t::next. def_t::alias is used to find the main def via one if its
		aliases. The order of the aliases in the list is arbitrary: it is the
		reverse of the order in which they were created.
