o = todo
X = done
? = maybe but not likely
M = more testing
I = in progress
W = waiting on other work


X  fix skybox/dome vis problems (workable solution found, needs new renderer)
X  It's possible to stick on some obtuse-angled corners qwsv 2.3x didn't
X  ~/.quakeforgerc should support all commands, not just set and setrom
X  software PCXs don't work in X11 at least if you're using 16/24/32 color
X  ogg support
X  server-side demos
M  it seems possible to crash a QF server still - need to fix this!
M  merge nq and qw code bases
M  mingw cross compiling
X  Scitech MGL used in win32 is screwed - dump it and use SDL
M  software targets should mix color at 16/16 or 24/32 color
I  GL is still way too slow
I  Client side QuakeC.
I  menu rewrite
I  clean up TODO ;)
o  doublesize modes (eg, render in 320x240 but display in 640x480)
o  allow qf clients to download .lit files from qf servers.
o  better server control of certain cvars
o  triggers (f_respawn, f_death, f_took; cl_triggers)
o  stateful console (eg, rcon mode, chat mode, normal command mode...)
o  scripted hud
o  add a U_PHYSICAL field to entities.  it should include a solid bit,
   a rotated bbox bit, and mins/maxs for the bbos
o  gui for serverlist
o  add favorates serverlist manipulation
o  redo serverlist filtering for better flexability and/or easier use
o  add individual server ping/info request from console
?  more direct intra-team comms (eg, talk to offense or defense directly)
?  Draw_Pic and friends need a cleanup in GL at least
?  Draw_Pic and other tex draw functions should use local palettes
?  improved crosshairs (custom file, 32 bit for GL, etc)
?  console commands to see a user, ignore talk from them, etc
?  wad loader should load wad3 and fall back to wad2 if necessary
?  better control over client console logging
?  ban reasons and expire times
?  no 512 entities limit (protocol limitation)
?  large or infinite (!) maps (currently has +-4096 protocol limit)
   (not just protocol, but bit precision, too)
?  redirection for file downloads
?  way to change con back besides changing mod dir (csqc likely)
?  movie-like demo controls (fastforward, rewind, step forward and back,
   seek, etc)
?  delta compression for protocol
?  transmit nails as source/direction/speed/time rather than
   direction/location, to improve delta compression
?  custom particle explosions (controlled via csqc)
?  server should shutdown cleanly when it recieves SIGTERM and SIGHUP
?  client-only commands (rejected if done via a server stuffcmd)
?  bring software-mode skybox code in from Quake 2
?  bring some assembly code for the software renderer in from Quake 2.

These are explained better in doc/ideas/rhamph.txt:
?  portal vis system
?  remappable portals
?  room duplication
?  randomly generated maps
?  variable detail models
?  skeletal model animations
?  Inverse kinematics
?  variable detail walls

[1] taniwha feels that formats is wrong and is using models with the
    following structure:
        libs
            models          generic api code
                alias       alias model loading code
                brush       brush model loading code
                sprite      sprite model loading code
            textures        texture reading/writing/management code

Decided old menu structure was pointless and nobody cared.
So we don't forget something in the binds menu:

  Attack
  Change weapon
  Jump / Swim up
  Walk forward
  Backpedal
  Turn left
  Turn right
  Run
  Step left
  Step right
  Sidestep
  Look up
  Look down
  Center view
  Mouse look
  Keyboard look
  Swim up
  Swim down
