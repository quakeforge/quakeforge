This is our new development tree (we're back to "quakeforge"), where we're again in the process of merging Quake and QuakeWorld ... but this time, it's much better. :), and will eventually provide the 0.6 versions of QuakeForge.

While almost always in working order, it's under heavy development so be prepared to encounter some issues (Wear your hard hat!). Please check the docs.

UNIX users: because of the diversity of machines QuakeForge runs on, we do not provide UNIX binaries. You need to compile QuakeForge yourself, however QuakeForge is very easy to compile once you have the following packages installed:

    * GNU autoconf 2.50 or later
    * GNU automake 1.6 or later
    * GNU libtool 1.4 or later
    * GNU bison
    * GNU flex
    * GNU make (BSD make doesn't like some constructs used)
    * C compiler and preprocessor (gcc and cpp recommended)
The following are recommended:
    * subversion (highly recommended for staying up to date with current
      changes)
    * zlib devel (highly recommended for compressed file and download support)
    * Ogg Vorbis libs (for compressed sound effects support)
    * X11 devel (for X11-based clients: software and OpenGL)
    * glide and mesa or other GL compatible lib
    * svgalib (for console-based clients: software and 3dfx)

Basic process to build and install QuakeForge:
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make install

You may want to check `./configure --help` and select options.

To build and install only the quakeworld server:
	./bootstrap
	./configure --without-clients --without-tools --with-servers=qw
	make install

To build documentation (doxygen is required, as is an already configured
source tree):
	cd doc
	make doc

Then either point your webbrowser to doxygen/html/index.html, or copy/move
doxygen/html to a webserver and point your browser to that. The documentation
is currently grossly inadequate, but hopefully it is of some help.
