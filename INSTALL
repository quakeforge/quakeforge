\page build-install Building and Installing QuakeForge

This is our new development tree (we're back to "quakeforge"), where we're
again in the process of merging Quake and QuakeWorld ... but this time,
it's much better. :), and will eventually provide the 0.6 versions of
QuakeForge.

While almost always in working order, it's under heavy development so be
prepared to encounter some issues (Wear your hard hat!). Please check the
docs.

\note UNIX users: because of the diversity of machines on which QuakeForge
runs , we do not provide UNIX binaries. You need to compile QuakeForge
yourself, however QuakeForge is very easy to compile once you have the
necessary packages installed.

\section req-pack Required Packages
The following packages are required to build QuakeForge:
\li GNU autoconf 2.71 or later
\li GNU automake 1.6 or later
\li GNU libtool 1.4 or later
\li GNU bison 2.6 or later
\li GNU flex
\li GNU make (BSD make doesn't like some constructs used)
\li C compiler and preprocessor (gcc and cpp recommended)
\li libsamplerate

\section rec-pack Recommended Packages
The following are recommended:
\li git (highly recommended for staying up to date with current changes)
\li zlib devel (highly recommended for compressed file and download support)
\li curl (for http download support (\ref qw_download_spec))
\li Ogg Vorbis libs (for compressed sound effects support)
\li X11 devel (for X11-based clients: software and OpenGL)
\li glide and mesa or other GL compatible lib
\li svgalib (for console-based clients: software and 3dfx)

\section building-and-installing Build and Install Procedure
Basic process to build and install QuakeForge:
\verbatim
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make install
\endverbatim

Note that when building from a git repository, the default is to treat
compiler warnings as errors. This can be changed by using the following:
\verbatim
	./configure --disable-Werror
\endverbatim

You may want to check <code>./configure --help</code> and select options.

To build and install only the quakeworld server:
\verbatim
	./bootstrap
	./configure --without-clients --without-tools --with-servers=qw
	make install
\endverbatim

To build documentation (doxygen, graphviz, mscgen and transfig are required),
in an already configured source tree:
\verbatim
	cd doc
	make doc
\endverbatim

If the tree has not been configured and doing so is not desirable or
possible, then the documentation may be configured separately:
\verbatim
	cd doc
	./docstrap
	./configure
	make doc
\endverbatim

Then either point your webbrowser to <code>doxygen/html/index.html</code>, or
copy/move <code>doxygen/html</code> to a webserver and point your browser
to that. The documentation is currently grossly inadequate, but hopefully
it is of some help.
