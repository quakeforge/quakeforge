	</table>

	The remote connection never knows if it missed a reliable message, the
	local side detects that it has been dropped by seeing a sequence
	acknowledge higher than the last reliable sequence, but without the
	correct even/odd bit for the reliable set.

	If the sender notices that a reliable message has been dropped, it will
	be retransmitted.  It will not be retransmitted again until a message
	after the retransmit has been acknowledged and the reliable still failed
	to get there.

	If the sequence number and reliable payload bits are all 1 (32bit -1),
	the packet is an out-of-band packet and should be handled without a
	netcon.

	The reliable message can be added to at any time by doing
	MSG_Write* (&netchan->message, data).

	If the message buffer is overflowed, either by a single message, or by
	multiple frames worth piling up while the last reliable transmit goes
	unacknowledged, the netchan signals a fatal error.

	Reliable messages are always placed first in a packet, then the unreliable
	message is included if there is sufficient room.

	To the receiver, there is no distinction between the reliable and
	unreliable parts of the message, they are just processed out as a single
	larger message.

	Illogical packet sequence numbers cause the packet to be dropped, but do
	not kill the connection.  This, combined with the tight window of valid
	reliable acknowledgement numbers provides protection against malicious
	address spoofing.

	The qport field is a workaround for bad address translating routers that
	sometimes remap the client's source port on a packet during gameplay.

	If the base part of the net address matches and the qport matches, then
	the channel matches even if the IP port differs.  The IP port should be
	updated to the new value before sending out any replies.
