/**	High-tide structure allocator for use in linked lists.

	Using a free-list with the name of \c NAME_freelist, return a single
	element. Also, the allocated blocks are recorded in a DARRAY with the name
	of \c NAME_blocks.
	The type of the element must be a structure with a field named \c next.
	When the free-list is empty, memory is claimed from the system in blocks.
	Elements may be returned to the pool by linking them into the free-list.

	\param s		The number of structures in the block.
	\param t		The structure type.
	\param n		The \c NAME portion of the \c NAME_freelist free-list.
	\param v		The destination of the pointer to the allocated
					element. The contents of the allocated element will be
					memset to 0.
