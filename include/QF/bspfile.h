/** \defgroup formats_bsp BSP Files

	BSP files are used for quake's maps and some pick-up items (health and
	ammo boxes in particular). The maps can be quite complicated, usually with
	many sub-models, while the pick-up items are usually simple boxes.

	QuakeForge supports two formats for BSP files "BSP 29", (the original
	format, with many 16-bit fields), and "BSP 2", all fields 32 bits. Both
	formats are little-endian.

	BSP files use a right-handed coordinate system with +Z up but clockwise
	winding for face normals.

	The tools used to create a bsp file include qfbsp, qfvis and qflight (or
	similar tools from other projects).

/** \defgroup bsp_entities Entity data string
	\ingroup formats_bsp

	Single string containing all the entity dictionaries (edicts).

	The format is extremely simple in that is is a series of blocks delimited
	by { and }. Blocks cannot be nested. A { after a { but before a } will be
	treated as either a key or a value. A } after a } but before a { is not
	valid. { must be the first non-whitespace character in the string. } must
	be the last non-whitespace character in the string if there is a {.

	The contents of a block consist of a series of key-value string pairs.
	Unless the string contains spaces or punctuaiont (one of "{}()':") double
	quote (") around the string are optional. Keys and values are separated
	by whitespace (optional if quotes are used) but must be on the same line,
	but it is best to use a space.  Key-value pairs may be on separate lines
	(prefered for readability).

	Key strings are Quake-C entity field names. Value strings are interpreted
	based on the type of the field.

	Below is a sample edict

	\verbatim
	{
	"origin" "-2528 -384 512"
	"angle" "270"
	"classname" "info_player_start"
	}

	As an extention, QuakeForge supports \ref property-list entity string data

	for leaf 0 (first row is for leaf 1's visible leafs), and the first bit
	in each row represents leaf 1.

	As well, the data within a row is compressed: runs of 0-bytes
	(representing eight non-visible leafs) are represented as a 0 followed
	by a single count byte. For example, a run of eight 0-bytes will appear
	as 0x00 0x08, and a single 0 byte will appear as 0x00 0x01.

/** \defgroup bsp_texture_animation BSP Texture Animation
	\ingroup formats_bsp

	Textures in BSP files can be animated. Animated textures are those
	with miptex names in a special format:

	\verbatim
	+Sname
	\endverbatim

	That is, the miptex name starts with a +, followed by a single sequence
	id character (0-9 or A-J (or a-j, case-insensitive)) then the name of the
	animation group is formed by the remaining characters. Thus an animation
	group can have one or two sequences with one to ten frames per sequence.
	The two sequences are the main sequence (0-9) and the alternate sequence
	(A-J). Gaps in a sequence are not allowed: there must always be a +0 or +A
	miptex in the sequence, and there must be a texture for every digit or
	letter up to the highest used. However, the miptex blocks can be in any
	order within the textures block: the engine searches for them and sorts
	them.

	Single-frame sequences are useful for simple static texture switching
	based on game state (entity frame: 0 for main, non-zero for alternate).
	Multi-frame sequences are played back at five frames per second.

	For example, the following sets up an animation with a 4-frame main
	sequence and a 2-frame alternate sequence. Perhaps a roaring fire in
	the main sequence and glowing coals in the alternate.

	\verbatim
	+0fire  // main sequence
	+1fire  // main sequence
	+2fire  // main sequence
	+3fire  // main sequence
	+Afire  // alternate sequence
	+Bfire  // alternate sequence
