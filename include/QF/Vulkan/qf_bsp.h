 *
 * For each texture that has faces to be rendered, one or more draw calls is

 * use the same texture, then a separate draw call is made for each model.
 * When multiple entities use the same model, instanced rendering is used to
 * draw all the faces sharing a texture for all the entities using that model.
 * Thus when there are multiple draw calls for a single texture, they are
 * grouped together so there is only one bind per texture.
 *
 * The index buffer is populated every frame with the vertex indices of the
 * faces to be rendered for the current frame, grouped by texture and instance
 * id (model render id).
 *
 * The model render id is assigned after models are loaded but before rendering
 * begins and remains constant until the next time models are loaded (level
 * change).
 *
 * The entid buffer is also populated every frame with the render id of the
 * entities to be drawn that frame, It is used to map gl_InstanceIndex to
 * entity id so as to look up the entity's transform and color (and any other
 * data in the future).
