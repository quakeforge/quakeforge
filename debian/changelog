quakeforge (0.2-20000308-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Unstable CVS snapshot
  * quake-* binaries are now named uquake-*
  * -gl targets are now more properly named -glx
  * Some minor annoyances with the status bar fixed in 0.1.1 have not been
    fixed in 0.2-d yet.  You won't see them, unless you play hip/rogue and
    they aren't really critical.
  * Sorry, no ~/.quake handling internally yet.

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Mar 2000 01:21:04 -0800

quakeforge (0.1.1-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix for people on Quack!
  * Fixed two nasty segfaults that could hose a box under SVGALib
  * Made UQuake statusbar behave sanely with cl_sbar 1 again
  * cl_sbar ignored properly in rogue/hipnotic--always assumed to be 1
  * default gl_clear to 1 so noclip doesn't do strange things onscreen
  * changed glClearColor to black so gl_clear 1 doesn't look like crap

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Feb 2000 03:31:31 -0800

quakeforge (0.1.0-1) frozen unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * "0.0.9-1" was actually "0.1-20000103-1"
  * Fixed the sig4's in the SVGALib-using targets
  * replaced qwprogs.dat, no longer segfaults (Closes: #54152)
  * -ip will let you bind a specific IP (Closes: #14445)  (I hope)
  * quake-svga is suid root like other svgalib apps now (Closes: #47954)
  * quake-x11 restores repeat properly on normal exit (Closes: #48018)
  * If /dev/dsp can't be opened, just don't use sound (Closes: #53533)
  * The return of the wrapper scripts..  They've been rewritten a bit for
    dealing with unpacked pak files.  A new quake-lib-stub is needed if your
    pak files are not all lowercase.  (Closes: #54153, #54221, #54634)
  * svgalib targets are i386 only at the moment  =<  (Closes: #54451)
  * Built with newer libsdl  (Closes: #54488)
  * README now notes the gl_ztrick issue..  Essentially ztrick is a hack
    Id used to keep from clearing the Z buffer, it worked with older Mesa
    and with the 3dfx GL MCD.  Mesa 3+ flicker madly, so it defaults to off
    in the -gl target.  You still have to disable it by hand for the -3dfx
    target (since it's intended to be used with the 3dfx GL MCD..)  If set
    once to 0 it will be saved in that state.  (Closes: #54530)
  * If you want to start -svga and -3dfx from X, use open.  Documented this
    in the README.  (Closes: #54595)
  * Package relationships updated/fixed.  (Closes: #54747, #54868)
  * docs are now installed more sanely.  (Closes: #54749)
  * bins and data owned by games isn't going to happen  (Closes: #54742)

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Jan 2000 13:26:24 -0800

quakeforge (0.0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new upstream version--Quake is GPL!

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Jan 2000 00:09:58 -0800

quake (1.09-1.30-2pre3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with new shlibs files - the shlibs files are now NORMAL shlibs
    files, but a patch to dpkg-shlibdeps is still required.
  * quake-common package - it exists now and everything depends on it,
    though it doesn't do anything yet but depend on the quake-lib's the
    way the quake bins used to.  Will eventually do useful stuff.
  * Fully FHS compliant now!
  * (Re)wrote descriptions for the packages
  * GLQuake packages depend on quake-common, this fixes a bug that would
    let you install glquake* without installing any quake-lib*'s..

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Sep 1999 14:19:53 -0700

quake (1.09-1.30-2pre3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hopefully ironed out the dependencies/shlibs stuff (still uses my .
    soname patch
  * Changed the wrappers of the glquake stuff a little

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jul 1999 10:54:47 -0700

quake (1.09-1.30-2pre3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Not released officially
  * build debs of the libs glquake bins are shipped with
  * build debs of the 3 glquake bins---all depend on the libs package FOR
    NOW (this will change) and there's no manpages for them yet, RTF
    README if you don't know the options.

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jul 1999 00:42:25 -0700

quake (1.09-1.30-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually compress the manpages this time

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Jun 1999 01:38:37 -0700

quake (1.09-1.30-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version - glibc2 binaries at last!
  * Since the quake binaries all came in one package, I've combined the
    squake and xquake packages.

 -- Joseph Carter <knghtbrd@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jun 1999 23:52:01 -0700

squake (1.09-1.1-15) unstable; urgency=low

squake (1.09-1.1-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Orphaned the package, I don't maintain non-free things anymore.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Thu, 18 Mar 1999 15:00:22 -0800

squake (1.09-1.1-13) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the copyright file with info from a very old mail from ID
    software in which they told me that repackaging it as a deb is not a
    deriviative work.
  * Updated the copyright file to include all of slicense.txt, instead of
    referencing it.
  * No code changes, and I think the copyright fixups are important enough
    to put it in to frozen.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  7 Dec 1998 15:34:16 -0800

squake (1.09-1.1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The wrapper can now handle uppercase .PAK files (#28781).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 31 Oct 1998 21:06:48 -0800

squake (1.09-1.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified wrapper so it will add /usr/games to the end of PATH, and run
    squake.real (w/o full filename). This is mainly to support some things
    aa quake will need to do.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Mon,  7 Sep 1998 16:58:08 -0700

squake (1.09-1.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

    isn't in the user's PATH.
  * Added a note to the README.Debian about the common squake is suid root,
    but mouse doesn't work problem.

    their home directory (#15452).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 29 Nov 1997 14:22:01 -0500

squake (1.09-1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debhelper.
  * Don't do the runme stuff anymore, becuase ID no longer distributes a
    runme script.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 16 Nov 1997 19:21:34 -0500

squake (1.09-1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 6 May 1997 20:37:13 -0400

squake (1.07-1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for /etc/suid.conf, not the suidmananger binary. Actually, I let
    debstd handle it. Maybe I've finally gotten this right..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 6 May 1997 20:37:13 -0400

squake (1.07-1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed stupid error; will install if suidmanager is not present now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 6 May 1997 20:14:23 -0400

squake (1.07-1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Register /usr/games/squake.real with suidregister, so permissions get
    preserved across upgrades. This lets you come up with your own security
    scheme for making squake suid.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 6 May 1997 16:10:04 -0400

squake (1.07-0.992-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * A security hole is known in squake which could allow users to get root
    if the program is installed suid. As a temporary fix until a fixed
    version is available, squake is no longer installed suid.
  * New upstream version.
  * Fixed a problem with the .orig.tar.gz file which was making dpkg-source
    refuse to unpack it.
  * Moved into contrib, which is the proper section for this package, as
    there is no source code available.
  * Converted menu file to menu-1 format.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 25 Apr 1997 15:34:37 -0400

squake (1.07-0.991-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to squake version 0.991.
  * Split quake source package into xquake and squake source packages.
    Had to do this becuase new versions of xquake and squake are coming out
    at different times.
  * Changed version number to reflect both the main quake revision number
    and the squake subrevision number.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Run dpkg-gencontrol after debstd, and delete substvars during clean.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 5 Apr 1997 21:33:44 -0500

quake (1.06-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified wrapper script so it reads /etc/quake.conf to determine where
    the quake libraries are. This will eliminate the need for symlinks if
    quake-lib-stub is used.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Run dpkg-gencontrol after debstd, and delete substvars during clean.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 22 Mar 1997 18:14:53 -0500

quake (1.06-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of the binary patching, and went over to small wrapper scripts
    that cd to /var/lib/games/quake. This is to fix bug #7767, -game didn't
    work.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Modifications for multiple binary package support.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sun, 2 Mar 1997 15:03:53 -0500

quake (1.06-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed s-bit from file in orig.tar.gz file, so dpkg-source -x will
    work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Wed, 26 Feb 1997 15:24:41 -0500

quake (1.06-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a squake binary (version 0.99), thanks to the work Dave 'Zoid'
    Kirsch.
  * Updated to new uptream release of xquake (thanks to Linus Torvalds for
    building the 1.06 xquake binaries (and for a few other things <g>)).
  * Split into 2 binary packages: xquake and squake.
  * Dropped xf86quake out of the package for now, as a 1.06 version is not
    available.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Modifications for multiple binary package support.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Fri, 7 Feb 1997 20:51:24 -0500

quake (1.01-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed an error message in xf86quake that told the user to chmod 666
    /dev/mem.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 4 Jan 1997 19:31:04 -0500

quake (1.01-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed libc5 dependancy to make users of debian 1.2 happy.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    Use build-stamp instead of build.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Tue, 31 Dec 1996 12:29:55 -0500

quake (1.01-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed quake-lib dependancy: requires exactly quake-lib 1.01, or
    the new quake-lib-stub package.
  * Modified README.debian to document that quake-lib greater than 1.01
    will likely not work with this version of quake.
  * xf86quake is no longer suid root, as that is almost certianly a security
    hole. Added documentation to README.debian about this.
  * Added a menu file.
  * Routine update of debian/rules:
    New email address.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>  Sat, 28 Dec 1996 14:56:08 -0500

quake (1.01-1) non-free; urgency=low

  * First release.
