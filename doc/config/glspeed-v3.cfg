gl_playermip "0"

// with gl_dlight_polyblend set to 1 and gl_dlight_lightmap set to 0 and get
// absolutely NO hit in speed.
r_dynamic "1"

// Turn on freaky bubble lighting. Really really fast, use this with r_dynamic
// 1 and gl_dlight_lightmap 0 so you can see static lights on the map
gl_dlight_polyblend "0"

// Turn this off to disable dynamic lightmaps. Only has effect with

// Normally sane people set it to 0... Because it's a speed hit if it's on.

cl_cshift_content "1"
