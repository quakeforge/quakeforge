NEWS for the QuakeForge project
-------------------------------
Changes from 0.6.99 Beta 1
    o The inverted lighting in sw32 render has been fixed.
    o The mdl import/export addon is now included in the distribution
      tarball/zip.
    o Server segfault when firing nails in qw has been fixed.
    o Server segfault when cancelling mvd recording fixed.
    o Unlimited signon buffers for qw.
    o Fix entity scaling issues in nq demos (gl).
    o An off-by-one error in qwe's substr implementation has been fixed.
    o Add support for the \s escape sequence (toggle bold characters) to
      qfcc, and fix many escape sequence handling bugs.
    o Add an "extended" compilation mode to qfcc. It implies traditional,
      but with extra keywords (switch, for, continue, case, default) that
      work with v6 progs.
    o Fix mis-handlihg of the output file specification in qfpreqcc.
    o sw32 and sw dynamic plugins now work.
    o Fix double drawing of the key-bindings menus.
    o serverinfo and localinfo can now disaplay the value for a single key.
    o "Prev. weapon" keybinding menu entry added.
    o Default vid_gamma is now 1.0 instead of 1.45.

Changes from 0.6.3
    o Renderer plugins. This means the same program is used for all
      renders. Which renderer to use is selected via the vid_render plugin
      (one of gl, glsl, sw, sw32; defaults to gl). Currently selectable
      only at startup ("+set vid_render gl" on the command line, or "set
      vid_render gl" in a startup config file (not config.cfg))
    o MDL skins can now be 1024x1024
    o GLSL renderer now works on (recent) nvidia drivers.
    o MDL import/export addon for blender can now export animated models
      (skins and mesh deformations) and handles MD16 (QF extension: mdl
      with 16 bit vertex data).
	o Jumping is now independent of frame rate. Whether you get 72 fps or
      22, you jump the same height. The height is the same as if you got
      infinite fps.
    o IQM support in all renderers.
    o 32 bit x86 builds support asm again.
    o inifinite think loop when playing honey fixed.
    o jack sound driver tries to reconnect to the jack server if the
      connection is lost.
    o demo format auto-detection: no need to worry about mistakenly playing
      a .qwd in nq or .dem in qw: the client will reject it with a message.
      Also, the qw client now autodetects mvd and qwd demos, preferring mvd
      over qwd if two demos have the same base name but different
      extensions.
    o view angles no longer messed up when loading a saved game.
      Thanks to mh.
    o frame-rate independe cshifts fades. Again, thanks to mh.
    o r_flatlightstyles now supported.
    o missing console prompt on demo stop fixed.
    o missing health picup sound on aerowalk (qw) fixed.
    o all entities lerped in nq.
    o qw server now supports antilag (from fteqw).
    o spectator name changes are no longer broadcast.
    o preliminary support for chat info in qw (client and server). The
      client currently only adds a dlight to the player (no icons yet).
    o glsl renderer speedups (~2x for bigass1, ~2.5x for overkill)
    o support for 32 mouse buttons added.
    o excessive beams removed.
    o "loading" plaque re-enabled.
    o smarter entity counting: maps with many entities but most of them get
      culled are now more likely to load with default settings (nq) or at
      all (qw).
    o qfcc changes
        o now supports "vector = quaternion * vector" as a shortcut for
          quaternion rotation. If the quaternion is not a unit quaternion,
          scaling will be the square of the length of the quaternion (same
          as for standard quaternion rotation).
        o bug fixed where params and return slot were offset in v6 progs.
        o progdefs.h now written correctly (with qfcc header, even, but the
          CRC is still correct). Writing is optional, but default for v6
          progs.
        o jumps are now threaded, with some better dead-code elimination.
        o qfcc's/ruamoko libs and headers are now in ${prefix}/share/qfcc
        o The correct function name is reported for the function with the
          most locals.
        o constant folding for unary operators, including float/int
          conversions.

Changes from 0.6.2
    o Compile fix for zlib 1.2.6.
    o Use CURL compile flags correctly.
    o Use the correct OpenGL library on OpenBSD.
    o Fix a crash in qw gl renderers when skin data updates come in before
      the player model has been loaded.
    o libQFgamecode now part of libQFruamoko (first step in installed
      libraries cleanup).
    o None of the renderer libraries are installed now: they're all built
      into the main binary.
    o Build system cleanup: less empty recursion.
    o Direct support for blender's environment maps as skyboxes. QF will
      now load a single image with (${skyname}_map.*) using blender's
      layout. That is, 3x2 with the top row being back, right, front and
      the bottom row being bottom, top, left.
	x Package building (deb and rpm) is broken.

Changes from 0.6.1
    o New renderer using GLSL. Currently looks very much like the original
      software renderer with the additions of translucency, skyboxes and fog.
      Also, it's mostly GLES ready.
    o Screenshots now get written to $fs_userpath/QF (ie, QF in the quake
      root) instead of the current gamedir.
    o Demo playback can be recorded (currently to PNG files as
      QF/qfnvNNNNNN.png) by adding "rec" as a second parameter to the
      playdemo command. The recording is for 30fps playback. Sound is not
      recorded at this stage.
    o SDL sound now works in most cases.
    o The blender mdl import/export script has been updated for blender
      2.61.
    o Partial cross-compile support for Android using the standalone ndk.
      Doesn't produce a usable app yet.
    o qfcc now has a --no-default-paths option to prevent qfcc including or
      linking installed headers or libraries.
    o Some more functions added to the Ruamoko draw api.
    o Message buffer API for Ruamoko.

Changes from 0.6.0
    o qfprogs has been moved from tools to qfcc (windows packages).
    o The software renderer can now cope with pics being off-screen.
    o A potential issue with reading past the end of PCX files has been fixed.
    o qfcc now accepts --no-default-paths. Mainly for building Ruamoko code in
      the main source tree, but useful for those that want to avoid libr.
    o A segfault involving old dirconfs has been fixed.
    o OSS sound should be working now.

Changes from 0.5.99 Beta 4.1
    o Many more keys supported in X11 (-glx, -x11) clients: most of the keys
      on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 v1.0 are supported (not
      the five user keys or the zoom knob because Linux doesn't seem to
      respond to them).

Changes from 0.5.99 Beta 3
    o Global fog now works for both multi and single texture rendering.
    o Z_Realloc() zeros the expanded part of the memory (thanks to sezero).

Changes from 0.5.99 Beta 2
    o Possibly better ktpro support (server now informs the mod about its
      MVDSV features)
    o Due to it being incompatible with most clients, the MVD time skip
      support has been removed.
    o Global fog improvements for non-mtex rendering. Still not there yet,
      though (hopefully next release).
    o The OpenGL error on startup has been silenced: the cause was found and
      taken out back of the barn.
    o A mistake in an OpenGL version check has been fixed (thanks to MH).
    o Setting gl_vaelements_max to -1 no longer causes QF to segfault
      (console text and particles now support fake vertex arrays).
    o Entity transform setup is now controled by the client rather than the
      renderers. Amongst other things, this means that static entities now
      setup their transform only once.
    o Ruamoko
        * Now has an __INFINITY__ built-in constant. It won't work on
          machines that don't support IEEE single floats, but then again,
          neither will quake.
        * Old cvar() and cvar_set() functions moved from system.h to cvar.h.

Changes from 0.5.99 Beta 1
    o The "loading" plaque has been reenabled.
    o The key for toggling the menu can now be adjusted via a cvar.
    o Similar for toggling the console.
    o The legacy "bind" and "unbind" commands have been reworked. They now
      affect only one table (IMT_MOD) that is below the main game tables.
      This protects the user's advanced bindings from mods.
    o A new key binding table has been added for use during demo playback
      (IMT_DEMO). This is separate to the main game tables, but above
      IMT_MOD (so important keys like F10 still work).
    o More OpenBSD fixes.
    o An apparent hang (sometimes crash) on a failed download in
      quakeworld has been fixed.
    o Ruamoko
        * More math functions and constants
        * Existing math functions should be faster

Changes from 0.5.5
    o General enhancements
        * many limits removed
            o unlimited nails (client side)
            o unlimited visible entities
            o unlimited static entities
            o for BSP files, only limits dictated by the format remain
        * linux joystick improvements:
            o default device is /dev/input/js0
            o up to 18 buttons
        * developer cvar is now a bit field
            o    1 everything
            o    2 warnings
            o    4 video
            o    8 file system: not found
            o   16 file system: found
            o   32 file system: general
            o   64 networking
            o  128 ruamoko: objects
            o  256 ruamoko: messages
            o  512 sound
            o 1024 GL textures
        * ALSA sound support now works with PulseAudio by default
        * NQ now works on multi-homed hosts
        * OpenBSD networking fixes
        * loss of contact with the jack server is now detected. no more
          hanging on shutdown after jack flakes out.
        * fishey rendering fixed
        * crash gracefully when a map has too many entities (rather than
          silently dropping them: coag3 wasn't fun with missing ents)
        * players can jump off pretty much anything (controllable via
          sv_jump_any)
        * funny size sound buffers no longer a problem
        * RLE encoding for PCX output
        * plugins moved to ${libdir}/quakeforge/plugins

        * large map support from fitzquake
        * fullscreen mode is now compliant with modern window managers
        * wide screens supported. Use the vid_aspect cvar to specify the
          screen's aspect ratio (eg, 4:3, 16:9, 800:480 etc).
        * lighting tweaks
        * don't lose sound when switching workplaces in X
        * correct resampling of sound effects for 48kHz sound output (or any
          other rate, for that matter).
        * support up to 7.1 channel sound files. However, output is still
          limited to two channels.
        * "lagged dlights" in mvds fixed
        * flac sound file support

        * plist access
        * entity parsing support
        * quake script parsing support
        * dynamic strings
        * mutable strings
        * progs can provide their own entity parsing function. A sample
          implementation is available.
    o qfcc
        * major rewrite of parser and code generation
            o C style declarations fully supported (bit fields ignored)
            o dead code elimination
            o better constant folding
            o Objective-QC runtime data moved into far data to avoid taking
              precious near data defs.
            o missing return statements in non-void functions now detected
              with a suitable warning
            o pointers and arrays now use C syntax
            o "integer" now "int"
        * field aliasing: .SEL thinkMethod = think;

        * allow entity.vector.x (etc) instead of entity.vector_x
        * many ObjectiveQuakeC fixes
        * optional constant-vector parameter space optimisation (slows down
          the code, though): can compile the version of frogbot that has
          waypoints for almost 300 maps.
        * rcall support
        * static local vars
        * more pointer support
        * better compatibility with qcc
        * preprocess progs.src
        * one-pass compilation of progs.src based code when using cpp
        * qccx escape codes supported. As there are conflicts with qfcc's
          escape codes, --qccx-escapes can be used to select qccx instead of
          qfcc.
        * explicit references to classes and categories via
          "@reference ClassName;" or "@reference ClassName(CategoryName);"
    o Tools
        * filter for displaying item information from a map (itemslist.py)
        * wad tool improvements
        * qfbsp can extract the entities data from bsp files.
        * qflmp: converts between lmp and pcx

        * more cvar renaming: scr_consize -> con_size, scr_conspeed ->
          con_speed, gl_conalpha -> con_alpha, vid_conwidth -> con_width,
          vid_conheight -> con_height, show_fps -> hud_fps, show_ping ->
          hud_ping, show_pl -> hud_pl, show_time -> hud_time, show_scoresuid ->
          hud_scoreboard_uid
        * demo_speed no longer affects console scrolling or cursor blink rate
        * save game loading fixed
        * FPS display now updated every 0.2 seconds and displays to the tenth
          of an fps
        * improper placement of fullscreen window on startup in -x11 and -glx
          fixed (ie, starting with +set vid_fullscreen 1)
        * QNX fixes from Mike Gorchak <mike@malva.ua>
        * DirectX is now the default sound driver for windows
        * renderer speedups
        * demo_quit cvar to cause qf to quit automaticly at the end of a
          timedemo to make automation of profiling easier
        * server clients work with mvds
        * never allow IP ports < 1024
        * prettier particles. affected by gravity in qw (protocol restrictions

        * Improvements in time accounting. Accurate to +-0.5ms, instead of -1,0
          like others. Based on Grievre's and zquake's code
        * mangled sounds on gamedir change fixed thanks to Grievre

        * add r_norefresh support to sw and sw32 and rename the console side of
          the cvar to cooperate better with the evil in customtf
        * new cvar from Grievre to control "fake" filtering and change the fake
          kick default
        * fix bug where certain looped sounds would cause a hang
        * 64 bit compile fixes
        * alias models are no longer black on maps with no lighting info
    o qfcc enhancements.
        * conforms better to Objective-C sematics
        * "struct" support closer to that of C (ie, separate namespace)
        * now supports the "unsigned" type (32 bit unsigned integer)
        * correct handling of ! and &&/|| for traditional code
        * linker error message improvements
        * better error checking in
        * can cast between pointers and integers
        * --traditional operator precedence conforms to qcc but --advanced to C
        * --traditional is default for progs.src and --advanced for separate
          compilation
        * much better qcc conformance in general for --traditional
        * more informative error reporting
        * if (const) now works properly (though dead code doesn't get
          eliminated)
        * allow constant expressions to be used for builtin numbers
        * better constant folding with auto-conversion between scalar types

        * non-const expressions for frame in state operator valid
        * computed functions for state think allowed
        * change --include FILE to pre-include a file rather than add a
          directory search path. Maps to -include FILE on the cpp command line.
        * all warnings (except for @self and self) are now fully controllable
        * --traditional now auto-inits uninitialized local vars
        * fast-float code option (defaults to on). kills almost 3000 statements
          from prozac
    o tools enhancements
        * wad utilty along the lines of pak. can't yet be used for wad creation
          (that's a little more complicated), but it can be used for listing
          and extracting the contents of a wad file. watch out for *foo :)
        * qfbsp
            - no longer zaps the bsp file when given a bsp instead of a map
              when compiling a map
            - watervis support
            - handle multiple wad files properly

              texture alighnment, partial "point of plane" autocorrection,
              hipnotic entity rotation
            - remove many arbitrary limits (edgs, points on windong, tokens and
              keys)
            - force axis aligned planes to truely be axis aligned (fixes
              degenerate polygons being generated by ClipWinding)
            - bsp to prt support (for watervising sourceless maps)
            - can now dump a map's textures to a wad file
            - various impovements from Vic via hqbsp (lordhavoc)
        * qflight
            - colored lighting support (from LordHavoc's hlight)
            - use vis data to speed up light passes
            - gzipped bsp support (reading only)
            - threading works
            - OpenQuartz's extentions (except -ikmap) brought in. id's light
              model is default
            - support properties files for setting default light settings for
              different light entity types
            - spotlight now works
        * pak
            - can specify files to extract from a pak
        * qfvis
            - support old-style portal files again
    o Progs engine/Ruamoko enhancements
        * Object root class revamped
        * progs debug/disassemble improvements
        * progs version update due to missing pointer in the symtab struct

        * progs string revamp: temp strings (eg, result from string + string)
          get freed when the creating funciton exits
        * new internal printf engine for progs
        * report all bad builtins rather than just the first. make the bad
          builtin number a warning and provide a suitable function in case the
          function is called: allows progs with bad (but unused) builtins to
          run anyway
        * progs dump print an address if the def name is blank
        * ruamoko math functions from Grievre
        * while not yet perfect, qfprogs now works with qfo files
        * new opcode: state.f. same as state, but takes a 3rd float operand to
          specify the step for calculating nextthink. accessed using
          [frame, think, step] (state is [frame, think])
        * progs handle x % 0 by giving a 0 result

Changes from 0.5.3
    o CRITICAL: exploitable buffer overflow in qw-server fixed
    o more gib regex and other text manipuation support
    o snd_oss_rw ditched in favour of just trying both ways

Changes from 0.5.2

    o General enhancements.
        * MVD playback in the qw clients.
        * MVD recording in the qw server.
          MVD support thanks to qwex 0.165b and highlander
        * sv_maxrate changes now take effect immediately rather than when
          clients (re)connect or change their rate
        * segfault when using "snd_output null" fixed
        * qw server "status" command now gives the server's uptime

        * partial string buffer audit
        * native Windows (win) sound driver finally works and is now default
        * DirectX sound support added (dx)
        * highchars stripped infokeys terminated properly so they don't contain
          garbage
        * WGL (nq-wgl.exe and qw-client-wgl.exe) resolution selection brought
          in line with all other targets giving the vid_width and vid_height
          cvars. Automatic aspect ratio support dropped.
        * X11 (nq-x11 and qw-client-x11) no longer hangs on 32bpp displays
        * new `view' system giving easier to control hud elements, centered
          menus and locatable scoreboard (hud_scoreboard_gravity)
        * OSS sound driver fixes: some kernel drivers need write-only access,
          others need read/write
        * able to load/unload semi-arbitrary plug-ins using console commands
        * streaming for large sound files (eg., full length oggs)
        * stereo sample support
        * map command in the rcon admin list
        * configurable "quake" directory layout
        * server now actually runs properly when there's no network or
          console input (eg, bots continue to battle unattended)
        * skydome (gl_sky_clip 0) renders correctly
        * external entity file support (maps/foo.bsp will use maps/foo.ent if
          available)
        * map specific config files
        * map specific external textures in "textures/mapname/"
        * support for more tga formats
        * vid_conwidth cvar

        * console operator chat messages get echoed
        * BSD fseek bug fixed
        * no_pogo_stick 3 mode forcing friction independent of jump being
          active
        * rcon password /never/ gets written as it may be legitimate for
          another server (ie, confused person :)

    o GIB enhancements
        * events system (map change, client enter/leave etc)
        * several bug fixes
        * documentation

    o qfcc enhancements.
        * @argc and @argv deprecated in favor of @args.count and @args.list
          (@args is a struct with type @va_list)
        * structure copy
        * -L lib search paths and -l now behaves in a more expected manner
        * default search paths for includes and libs

        * [super ...] messages work
        * categories work
        * nested and struct block initializers work
        * can access vector elements as vec.x as well as vec_x
        * void (void) func; is now valid (no params)
        * initialized globals can be used any place a true constant is expected

    o qfbsp/qflight/qfvis enhancements
        * various crash bug fixes
        * hint, skip and detail brush support
        * emit clipnodes in the correct order
        * groks quest's "map2" format in addition to the original format

    o Progs engine enhancements.
        * arbitrary size data copying
        * optionally handle division by 0 gracefully

Changes from 0.3.0

    o General enhancements.
        * NQ (quake1, single player, NetQuake, WinQuake) is back.
        * Video (driver and renderer), audio, gamecode (progs), console,
          model loading and general utility code shared in common libs between
          NQ and QW
        * Plugin system for sound and cd drivers.
        * Ogg Vorbis compression for sound effect samples (streamed ogg support
          is planned).
        * Menu system re-written in QuakeC/Ruamoko
        * Curses console for servers in Unix.
        * New key binding system.

    o Progs engine enhancements.
        * Fully modular. Mod/Server-independent, allowing for
          stand-alone QuakeC interpreter and client-side code.
        * The engine is no longer dependent on progdefs.h. This makes
          QuakeForge have trouble with QuakeC compilers that strip
          symbol names -- but those can be repaired using the new
          "qfdefs" tool.
        * New basic types, and instructions for using them, for version
          0.fff.002 progs (Quake's Version 6 is still supported).
        * Better dynamic string handling. Dynamic strings are
          garbage-collected.
        * Object-oriented runtime system, in the style of Objective-C.
        * Runtime fixups of built-in functions whose builtin number is
          zero. If a built-in function is available to the engine, with
          the same name given in the source code (e.g.
          "void (void) coredump = #0;"), the engine will set the value
          to the actual number used by the engine.
        * Debugging support (needs compiler support, which qfcc
          provides), including line-number information. Can display the
          line of text in the source on which an error occurred, if the
          new Cvar "pr_source_path" is set correctly.
        * Instruction-level code dumps are now formatted in an
          easier-to-read "assembly-code" format.

    o QuakeForge Code Compiler, qfcc -- a replacement for qcc.
        * Uses libQFutil for general utility functions such as hash
          tables, file access (incomplete), and pak files.
        * Uses libQFgamecode for progs information, such as opcode
          tables, enums, types, etc.)
        * Uses a lex/yacc (actually, Flex and Bison) scanner/parser
          architecture, like a "real" compiler does.
        * Drastically reduces the number of global defs needed for
          a given progs, by reusing temporary globals when possible.
        * All functions use the same block of defs for their local
          variables (compatible with all known servers), which further
          reduces the number of global defs needed.
        * Nested/chained function calls work properly.
        * Simple expressions, such as "a = b + c", compile to a single
          instruction instead of two, and do not use a temporary
          variable.
        * Local variables can be initialized to known values, as in
          "local float foo = 0.1;".
        * Uses the C preprocessor, so header files are now possible and
          useful.
        * The compiler checks for uninitialized and unused variables in
          functions, to help in finding errors.
        * The compiler can generate and use object files, for separate
          compilation (you don't have to compile all of your source all
          the time, only the parts that have changed). Normally, object
          files have a .qfo extension.
        * The compiler can link libraries, which are implemented as .qfo
          files inside pak archives.
        * The compiler implements stricter type checking, to assist in
          finding and fixing code errors.
        * The C language's "for", "do...while", and "switch" control
          structures have been adopted to provide a richer set of
          structures for programmers to use.
        * Additional functionality is given for progs that are to be
          used with QuakeForge's more advanced progs engine:

            x IMPORTANT:
              The order of operations is slightly different in "native"
              mode. The evaluation of "!foo & bar" is no longer
              "!(foo & bar)", but rather "(!foo) & bar". The new order of
              operations rules is more correct, but is different from how
              QCC evaluated. If you give the --traditional switch to
              qfcc's command-line, the old behavior is used.
            x The compiler now allows you to create your own functions
              that can accept a variable number of arguments, using the
              special "..." notation. The special constants "@argc" and
              "@argv" help with this. @argc contains the number of
              arguments, and @argv contains a list of those arguments. The
              handling of this is an improvement on C's vararg function
              handling, in our opinion, made possible by how the Quake
              system works.
            x New basic types: integer, pointer, enum, and id.
            x You can create new complex types, like arrays, structures,
              and unions, and allocate them at runtime.
            x String operators. You can add strings together to
              concatenate them, and you can compare their contents using
              the <=, <, >, >= operators.
            x The integer type has the full array of C operations
              available to it.
            x QFCC and QuakeForge now contain an object-oriented
              programming system, in the style of Objective-C and
              Smalltalk. It's *very* powerful, and can be used to create
              lots of interesting new things with rather little effort. If
              you don't wish to use the new system, you can safely ignore
              it with no danger to your code. :)
            x Special support for using the "self" special variable inside
              OO methods as well as the entity of the same name. If you
              use OO support for entities and want to assign a method as a
              touch/think/etc. function, "self" always refers to the
              object that "owns" the method being executed. The special
              variable "@self" was created to refer to the self entity.
              "@this" refers to the object.

    o Enhanced console scripting - GIB (GIB Isn't Bash)
        * New language derived from the quake console.
        * Functions with arguments and return values.
        * Looping (while, for) and branching (if) commands.
        * Local and global variables as well as access to cvars.
          Supports Python-like slicing of variables.
        * A basic math interpreter that respects order of operations
          and provides most arithmetic and logic operators.
        * Non-preemptive threading and callbacks to GIB functions in
          response to game events (limited but functional at the moment)
        * File reading, writing, and searching.
        * Integrates with console -- GIB functions can be exported as
          console commands to be used at the console or in binds.
        * See gib.html in doc for more information.

    o Enhanced time cheat ("speed cheat") protection
        * Time cheats work for only a split-second before protection
          kicks in.
        * Players moving with wrong timings are sped up/slowed down to
          the correct speed.
        * Delay before protection activates means that lag and normal
          network latency won't affect protection.
        * People who aren't really trying to cheat won't be kicked :)

    o Rendering enhancements
        * Experimental 32 bit software renderer.
        * Dynamic lights don't shine through walls.
        * Colored alias model lighting for GL.
        * Vertex Array use for sprites, particles and text. No fallbacks yet,
          so QF wont work with old or broken GL drivers. 
        * Switchable particle styles: r_particles_style 0 for Id. Default is 1,
          for lower particle count, larger texture particle effects.
        * 16 bit vertex alias model format.
        * Improved software gamma that more closely resembles hardware gamma.
        * Countless speed improvements.

Known problems in 0.5.2:
    o Doesn't work with 3dfx cards in MS Windows due to vertex array use.
    o SDL clients don't reliably support fullscreen mode in MS Windows
    o MS Windows support in general is sorely under-tested.
    o Starting an SDL client (-sdl, -sgl or -sdl32) in fullscreen mode
      and then going windowed requires in_grab to be toggled from 0 to 1
      and back to 0 before the mouse will be released.
